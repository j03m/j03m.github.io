                    <p>Well, no it didn&#39;t. But this blog for all intents an purposes created by the
                        tools it aims to describe and serves as an outline as to how a server-less blog
                        can be created using github.io for hosting, nodejs and gulp.</p>
                    <p>I immediately dug the instantness of github.io. Being pretty bare bones though
                        I was initially woed by Jekyll. About a quarter of the way into the instructions
                        though, I found myself saying. You know what - you&#39;ve done so little web stuff
                        in recent days. Why don&#39;t you take a moment and build it out yourself?</p>
                    <p>The first thing I knew is I wanted to write in my editor of choice using
                        Markdown because, well, Markdown is fast, fluent, easy and we all know it well
                        from creating github README.mds. I had no interest in web based editors. I tried
                        Medium and couldn&#39;t figure out a way to format a code snippet that could compete
                        with Github&#39;s very simple &amp;#96&amp;#96&amp;#96javascript.</p>
