I'm going to evaluate it and potentially modifiy it to publish to github.io, but there are also a bunch of benefits to medium, so we'll see.I immediately dug the idea of the github.io powered blog. As a publishing system,\nI was initially wooed by Jekyll. About a quarter of the way into the instructions\nthough, I found myself saying, \"I want to do this from gulp, and I want to just\nown the whole publishing chain.\" Jekyll also requires ruby last I looked and I\nwanted to have something that was completely driven from node, gulp and git."}}
