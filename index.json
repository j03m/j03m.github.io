As a publishing system,\nI was initially wooed by Jekyll. About a quarter of the way into the instructions\nthough, I found myself saying, \"I want to do this from gulp, and I want to just\nown the whole publishing chain and I want to control the UI.\" I probably could\nhave forked Jekyll, but well, there was ruby and I didn't want that. The result\nis an interesting take on publishing done with only the same javascript tools. I would use to do my development.The first thing I knew is I wanted to write in my editor of choice using\nMarkdown because, well, Markdown is fast, fluent, easy and we all know it well\nfrom creating github README.mds. I had no interest in web based editors. There\nwas nothing they really offered I couldn't do with markdown and markdown in my\nmind was just easier to write."}}
